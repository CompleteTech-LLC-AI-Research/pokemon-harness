"""Structural sentinels that keep #261/#270 assertions load-bearing (#270).

``tests/test_timed_menu_milestones.py`` carries the frame-bound retention
contract, but two of its assertions can be deleted or relaxed without any
behavioural test noticing:

* ``assert_not_deadline_truncated(record)`` is the #261 guard. It is *correct*
  and it does fire when the wall clock wins, but nothing checks that the call
  is still wired into ``run_owner``. Rewriting ``if clock_step == 0.0:`` to
  ``if False:`` leaves the whole file green (see #270 Finding 1).
* Four sites assert an exact call count (``== 300`` / ``== 271``). Relaxing any
  of them to ``>=`` turns the retention contract into "at least one call"
  without failing (see #270 Finding 2).

Neither gap is observable from the *return value* of a passing run, so a
behavioural assertion cannot catch it -- the same reasoning that made #271 pin
the clock read by inspecting source. These helpers therefore parse the test
module's AST and assert on structure. They are the backstop for structure; the
behavioural assertions remain the load-bearing contract.

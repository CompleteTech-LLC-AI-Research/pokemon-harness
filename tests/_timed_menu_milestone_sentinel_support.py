"""Structural sentinels that keep #261/#270 assertions load-bearing (#270).

``tests/test_timed_menu_milestones.py`` carries the frame-bound retention
contract, but two of its assertions can be deleted or relaxed without any
behavioural test noticing:

* ``assert_not_deadline_truncated(record)`` is the #261 guard. It is *correct*
  and it does fire when the wall clock wins, but nothing checks that the call
  is still wired into ``run_owner``. Rewriting ``if clock_step == 0.0:`` to
  ``if False:`` leaves the whole file green (see #270 Finding 1).
* Four sites assert an exact call count (``== 300`` / ``== 271``). Relaxing any
  of them to ``>=`` turns the retention contract into "at least one call"
  without failing (see #270 Finding 2).

Neither gap is observable from the *return value* of a passing run, so a
behavioural assertion cannot catch it -- the same reasoning that made #271 pin
the clock read by inspecting source. These helpers therefore parse the test
module's AST and assert on structure. They are the backstop for structure; the
behavioural assertions remain the load-bearing contract.

The structural checks ask whether a pinned assertion is *enforced*, not merely
*present*. Presence alone is satisfiable by an assertion wrapped in
``try/except AssertionError: pass``, which leaves the node in the AST, leaves
the comparison in place, and leaves the owning test unable to fail (#280).
``_is_enforced`` is the shared answer to that question and is used by both the
teeth check and the count check.

    All four sites get the #261 terminal-state precondition centrally, from

    default ``0.0``. A site that passed its own ``clock_step`` would silently
    opt out of the precondition, leaving its exact count asserting something the
    guard never qualified. Returns the offending ``(function, clock_step)``

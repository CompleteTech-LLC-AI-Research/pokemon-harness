"""Sentinels that keep the #261 guard and the retention counts load-bearing (#270).

``tests/test_timed_menu_milestones.py`` holds the frame-bound retention
contract, but two of its assertions can be removed or relaxed with every
behavioural test still green. This module pins them structurally.

Both gaps were confirmed on ``master`` before this file existed:

* ``if clock_step == 0.0:`` -> ``if False:`` leaves the milestones + frame-bound
  files at **83 passed, 0 failed** (Finding 1: the #261 guard is unwired).
* additionally relaxing ``assert len(calls) == 300`` to ``>= 1`` also leaves
  **83 passed, 0 failed** (Finding 2: the exact counts are unpinned).

These checks are structural -- AST inspection -- because that is the only way
to catch a *deletion*. The #261 guard is proven non-vacuous behaviourally (it
fires with 8 failures when production is mutated so the wall clock wins), so
what is missing is only the proof that it is still wired. The behavioural
assertions in the milestones module remain the contract; this file is the
backstop that keeps them from being quietly removed.

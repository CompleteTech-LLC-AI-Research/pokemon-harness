"""Sentinels that keep the #261 guard and the retention counts load-bearing (#270).

``tests/test_timed_menu_milestones.py`` holds the frame-bound retention
contract, but two of its assertions can be removed or relaxed with every
behavioural test still green. This module pins them structurally.

Both gaps were confirmed on ``master`` before this file existed:

* ``if clock_step == 0.0:`` -> ``if False:`` leaves the milestones + frame-bound
  files at **83 passed, 0 failed** (Finding 1: the #261 guard is unwired).
* additionally relaxing ``assert len(calls) == 300`` to ``>= 1`` also leaves
  **83 passed, 0 failed** (Finding 2: the exact counts are unpinned).

These checks are structural -- AST inspection -- because that is the only way
to catch a *deletion*. The #261 guard is proven non-vacuous behaviourally (it
fires with 8 failures when production is mutated so the wall clock wins), so
what is missing is only the proof that it is still wired. The behavioural
assertions in the milestones module remain the contract; this file is the
backstop that keeps them from being quietly removed.

    A rule that is too narrow leaves a present-but-dead pinned assertion
    certified as load-bearing; a rule that is too wide drops a live contract
    from the sentinel's view, which is the more damaging of the two errors. The

#: #310: the ``.__enter__()`` dunder spelling, which shipped in #309 with no

#: first and foremost to make that impossible.
#:
#: The rule had a second defect, found by running it: it read the exception
#: types from the *``__enter__()``* call's arguments instead of the suppressor's.
#: The outer call has none, so every dunder spelling fell back to the unreadable
#: case ``BaseException`` -- which catches ``AssertionError`` -- and reported
#: ``suppress(ValueError).__enter__()`` as a defeat of the assert. The
#: ``ValueError``/``RuntimeError`` rows below are that defect's regression test.
#:
#: The loud-vs-silent question is settled by measurement, not taste: *any*
#: ``X.__enter__()`` returns ``None``, so the ``with`` body never runs and
#: ``TypeError`` is raised. The dunder form is therefore never a silent defeat.
#: The rule still flags it, and that is a deliberate conservative choice --
#: the shape is broken, and reporting a broken contract as not-load-bearing is
#: the safe direction. It is recorded here so the choice is visible rather
#: than implied.

#: #324: a walrus in a ``with`` header binds the name for the rest of the
#: enclosing scope, so a *later* header that re-enters that name enters the
#: same suppressor. ``NamedExpr`` is not an ``ast.Assign``, so the binding was
#: never recorded and the re-entering assert was reported live -- a defeated
#: assert certified as load-bearing, which is the damaging direction.
#:
#: The rows below compare the full list of verdicts rather than reducing it
#: with ``all()``. Each fixture holds more than one assert whose verdicts are
#: *not* all the same, and ``all()`` collapses such a fixture to its first
#: verdict -- so a wrong second verdict passed the shipped table. That harness
#: bug is itself fixed here; the exact comparison is what keeps these rows
#: honest.
#
#: Every fixture is two- or three-assert on purpose: the first assert is the
#: one already covered by the single-header walrus rows, and the later
#: assert(s) are the ones this issue is about.

"""Sentinels that keep the #261 guard and the retention counts load-bearing (#270).

``tests/test_timed_menu_milestones.py`` holds the frame-bound retention
contract, but two of its assertions can be removed or relaxed with every
behavioural test still green. This module pins them structurally.

Both gaps were confirmed on ``master`` before this file existed:

* ``if clock_step == 0.0:`` -> ``if False:`` leaves the milestones + frame-bound
  files at **83 passed, 0 failed** (Finding 1: the #261 guard is unwired).
* additionally relaxing ``assert len(calls) == 300`` to ``>= 1`` also leaves
  **83 passed, 0 failed** (Finding 2: the exact counts are unpinned).

These checks are structural -- AST inspection -- because that is the only way
to catch a *deletion*. The #261 guard is proven non-vacuous behaviourally (it
fires with 8 failures when production is mutated so the wall clock wins), so
what is missing is only the proof that it is still wired. The behavioural
assertions in the milestones module remain the contract; this file is the
backstop that keeps them from being quietly removed.

    A rule that is too narrow leaves a present-but-dead pinned assertion
    certified as load-bearing; a rule that is too wide drops a live contract
    from the sentinel's view, which is the more damaging of the two errors. The

#: #310: the ``.__enter__()`` dunder spelling, which shipped in #309 with no

#: first and foremost to make that impossible.
#:
#: The rule had a second defect, found by running it: it read the exception
#: types from the *``__enter__()``* call's arguments instead of the suppressor's.
#: The outer call has none, so every dunder spelling fell back to the unreadable
#: case ``BaseException`` -- which catches ``AssertionError`` -- and reported
#: ``suppress(ValueError).__enter__()`` as a defeat of the assert. The
#: ``ValueError``/``RuntimeError`` rows below are that defect's regression test.
#:
#: The loud-vs-silent question is settled by measurement, not taste: *any*
#: ``X.__enter__()`` returns ``None``, so the ``with`` body never runs and
#: ``TypeError`` is raised. The dunder form is therefore never a silent defeat.
#: The rule still flags it, and that is a deliberate conservative choice --
#: the shape is broken, and reporting a broken contract as not-load-bearing is
#: the safe direction. It is recorded here so the choice is visible rather
#: than implied.

#: #324: a walrus in a ``with`` header binds the name for the rest of the

#: never recorded and the re-entering assert was reported live -- a defeated

):
    """A carried suppressor must not outlive the name being rebound.

    Each row binds a suppressor through a walrus, then rebinds that name in a
    different syntactic form, then enters it. The first assert is swallowed by
    the walrus-bound suppressor on **every** row -- that is the retirement
    claim, and it is ``False`` throughout.

    The second assert divides, and the division is the point. It used to be
    pinned to a single ``[False, True]`` for all eleven rows, which was wrong
    twice over: the two async rows are not even executable (they sit inside a
    plain ``def`` and call an undefined ``gen()``), and no row was ever run --
    there is no ``exec``, ``compile`` or ``eval`` in the body, only
    ``ast.parse`` and a call to the checker. A table that only reads the
    checker cannot notice when its claim and the checker's answer are wrong
    together.

    Executed on CPython, the rows split cleanly in two:

    * ``second_assert_live`` -- the rebind leaves ``cs`` bound to something
      enterable, so ``with cs:`` succeeds and the assert is a real contract.
      That covers every row whose right-hand side is a *call*:
      ``cs = contextlib.nullcontext()``, ``cs, other = (nullcontext(), 2)``,
      ``[cs] = [nullcontext()]``, the annotated store, and
      ``for cs in (nullcontext(),):``. Destructuring is not special here --
      the name still receives a real context manager, just one element out of
      a container. The async loop row is here for a second reason, and it is
      the one row whose entry is genuinely undecidable: the rule cannot read
      the element type out of an arbitrary async iterable, so it declines
      rather than guessing, and this row pins that choice. See
      :func:`_async_loop_target_is_undecidable` for the evidence.
    * ``not second_assert_live`` -- the rebind leaves ``cs`` holding something
      that cannot be entered, so the header raises before the body runs and
      the assert is unreachable. ``with nullcontext() as cs:`` binds
      ``__enter__``'s return value, which is ``None``; ``except E as cs:``
      and ``del cs`` unbind the name; ``async for cs in gen()`` binds the loop
      variable, an ``int``.

    The first half of each row is the retirement contract and the second is
    the entry contract, and they are independent: both are asserted, and the
    entry half is checked against the interpreter rather than against the
    analyzer it is supposed to police.
